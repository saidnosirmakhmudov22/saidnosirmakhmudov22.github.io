    <h1>Hi, I’m Saidnosir Makhmudov</h1>
    <p class="bubble">
      Greetings from Margilan, Uzbekistan! I’m Saidnosir, deeply proud of my hometown nestled in the lush Fergana Valley. Margilan is a city of two thousand years, a true gem on the Silk Road—and an amazing place I’m thrilled to share with you.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Margilan is Special</h2>
    <p class="bubble">
      Margilan has earned the title of “Silk Capital of Uzbekistan” for its centuries-old craft of hand-weaving rich fabrics like <em>atlas</em> and <em>adras</em>. These textiles were once prized across the Silk Road—from Baghdad to Greece. Even today, artisans continue using time-honored techniques to create stunning fabrics.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
    </p>
    <p class="bubble">
      The Yodgorlik Silk Factory still performs the entire silk-making process by hand, from cocoon to cloth, preserving traditional craftsmanship. In 2017, this heritage was recognized by UNESCO for safeguarding the technology of atlas & adras production.:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>
    <p class="bubble">
      Margilan is also rich in architectural beauty—highlighted by sites like the 16th-century Khonakhan Mosque with its towering cedar pillars, the romantic Pir Siddiq complex (also called “Kaptarlik” for its doves), the historic Said Akhmad-Khoja Madrasah, and the Khoja Maggiz Mausoleum.:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
    </p>
    <p class="bubble">
      According to legend, the name “Margilan” was born when Alexander the Great was served chicken and bread—“Murginon” in local tongue—and named the place after the dish. True or not, it’s a charming part of the city’s lore.:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
    </p>
    <p class="bubble">
      Beyond silk and stories, the Kumtepa Bazaar is a lively cultural heart—where colorful fabrics, fresh produce, spices, and traditional life blend in a vibrant tapestry of sights and sounds.:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
